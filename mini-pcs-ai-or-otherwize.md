**Important Note on "Local AI Capabilities":**
* **NPU (Neural Processing Unit):** Dedicated hardware for AI tasks, offering high efficiency for specific workloads like background blur, noise cancellation, and accelerating AI frameworks that leverage it (e.g., OpenVINO, Windows Studio Effects). Measured in TOPS (Tera Operations Per Second).
* **Integrated GPU (iGPU):** Crucial for offloading layers of Large Language Models (LLMs) and for image generation (e.g., Stable Diffusion). Performance varies greatly by model.
* **CPU:** Can run LLMs entirely, especially smaller ones or quantized versions, but generally slower than leveraging an iGPU or NPU where applicable.
* **RAM:** Essential for loading LLM models into memory. More RAM allows for larger models and better iGPU performance (as iGPUs use system RAM as VRAM).
