It can also perform some local learning from your codebase for more tailored suggestions.                                                                 |
| **Codeium** | Free AI code completion and chat.                                            | **Hybrid (mostly Remote for free tier):** The free individual plan primarily uses remote models. They offer an "offline installation version for enterprises," indicating local or hybrid options are available for larger organizations.                |
| **Continue** | Open-source AI code assistant for customizable code generation, editing, chat. | **Hybrid (strong local support):** Designed for flexibility. Supports running models locally (e.g., via Ollama, or downloading models directly) for privacy and offline use. Also connects to remote APIs if preferred.                               |
| **AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code** | Comprehensive environment for building, testing, and deploying generative AI models. | **Hybrid (strong local and remote support):** Explicitly designed to support both remote models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and local models (Hugging Face downloads, Ollama integration, or "Bring Your Own Models").                                     |
| **IntelliCode** | AI-assisted development (Microsoft): context-aware completions, repetitive edit detection. | **Hybrid:** Leverages patterns from vast cloud-based codebases for smart completions. Some features, like repetitive edit detection, perform local analysis on your machine.                                                                       |
| **Bito** | Versatile AI assistant for code generation, syntax, tests, explanations.     | **Remote:** Connects to powerful LLMs (like GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5) hosted remotely. Your code snippets are sent to their cloud for AI processing.                                                                                                |
| **CodiumAI** | Analyzes code and generates meaningful tests.                                | **Hybrid/Remote-leaning:** While it performs analysis on your code to generate tests, its advanced AI capabilities likely involve sending data to remote servers for processing. Some users note it "works quite well locally," suggesting some local components. |
| **Blackbox** | AI-powered code search, generation, and autocomplete.                        | **Remote:** Its AI features (code completion, chat, commit generation) rely on remote LLMs.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Mintlify Doc Writer** | Generates AI-powered documentation for code.                                 | **Remote:** Likely uses remote AI services to process your code and generate documentation.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Denigma** | Explains code in natural language.                                           | **Remote:** For its natural language explanations, it likely sends code snippets to a remote AI service for processing.                                                                                                                                |
| **Code Spell Checker** | Detects and fixes spelling errors in code and comments.                      | **Local:** Entirely local. It uses local dictionaries and patterns to check for spelling errors. No code is sent externally.                                                                                                                            |
| **Better Comments** | Improves code documentation with color-coded comment highlights.             | **Local:** Purely local. It only handles the visual styling of comments within your editor and does not use external AI.                                                                                                                                |
| **GitLens** | Supercharges Git capabilities, with added AI features.                       | **Hybrid:** Core Git features are local. Newer AI features like "AI Explain Commit" are powered by GitKraken AI, which likely involves remote processing.                                                                                             |

**Key to Understanding Local vs. Remote:**

* **Local Execution:** The AI model runs entirely on your machine. This generally offers:
    * **Enhanced Privacy/Security:** Your code doesn't leave your local environment.
    * **Offline Capability:** You can use the AI features without an internet connection (once the model is downloaded).
    * **Potential Performance:** If you have powerful local hardware (especially a good GPU), it can be very fast as there's no network latency.
    * **Resource Intensive:** Running large AI models locally can consume significant CPU, RAM, and GPU resources.

* **Remote Execution (Cloud-based API):** The AI model runs on servers provided by the extension developer or a third-party AI service. This offers:
    * **Accessibility to Powerful Models:** Access to very large and complex AI models that would be impractical to run locally.
    * **Lower Local Resource Usage:** Your machine mostly handles sending and receiving data, offloading the heavy computation.
    * **Ease of Use:** Often requires minimal setup beyond installing the extension and authenticating.
    * **Internet Dependency:** Requires an active internet connection to function.
    * **Data Privacy Concerns:** Your code (or parts of it) is sent to remote servers, so it's important to understand the extension's privacy policy.

As AI models become more efficient and local inference technologies improve (like Ollama), more extensions are offering or moving towards stronger local execution options.
